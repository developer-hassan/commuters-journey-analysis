# commuters-journey-analysis
Python project using Data analysis libraries like pandas, matplotlib to analyze the commuters dataset and get interesting insights from the data.

## About the project

The dataset for the problem comprises records of commuter journeys. The Python codes are to be expressed to analyse the commuters journeys. We have to perform different data preperation tasks and then we would get different insights from the data.

## Folder Structure:

1. Data                       ------ This directory contains the .csv file which is the provided data file of commuters data.
2. Jupyter Solution           ------ This directory contains the .ipynb file which contains the solution
3. Observation Screenshots    ------ This directory contains all the outputs that are displayed after running the python code (except the plots because those are in plots directory).
4. Plots 	                    ------ This directory contains the plots which are made during the solution of problem.
5. Report 	                  ------ This directory has the report in .docx format describing the situation of the project and the data analysis.
